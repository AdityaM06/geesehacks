# Reel Time Stock$

## Overview
Reel Time Stocks takes advantage of the Gen Z population's affinity for social media and the convenience of mobile apps to create an optimized financial learning platform (with an emphasis on stock trading) for the youth of today. Our app is meticulously designed to resonate with Gen Zâ€™s digital habits and preferences. Recognizing that over 60% of Gen Z-ers will not use an app or website that is too slow to load, we prioritize a fast, intuitive, and visually appealing interface to ensure a seamless user experience.

## How It Works
### Our app has 3 main features
1. A reels feature where users can scroll through short-form content in the format of "Reddit stories" that teach the user import things about financial literacy, while also providing long term investment advice.
2.An interactive stock interface, where users can search for real time data on stocks. They can also use this page to buy and sell stocks, assuming that they have sufficient funds. We used the Yahoo Finance API provided by RapidAPI to fetch this data.
3. A portfolio page that tracks what stocks you own, and provides a clean user interface displaying a distribution of your investments as well as live displays of your stocks, their current prices, and the percent changes on the day.

## How we Built It
Our project was set up in a React Native environment, and we used various technologies including:

Yahoo Finance API to get real time stock market data
React Native to set up a developer environment for our web app
Vercel to easily and seamlessly host our app on the internet
